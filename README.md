# Coding-Quiz-Challenge
This weeks Challenge was to create a Quiz testing the user's knowledge in coding.
The purpose of this challenge was to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages to create an interactive quiz that counts down the time left to finish. The user must answer correctly or else the time gets deducted! After the questions have been answered the user is shown their final score and prompted to save their name on the scoreboard. Following that, there is a prompt to try again.
## Visuals
Included below are sample images of the quiz at different stages of the experience as well as a link to the deployed webpage below!
